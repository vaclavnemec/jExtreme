jExtreme
=========

jExtreme is Java 8 library which allows mathematical optimization for functions. Library offers three optimization algorithms so far:

  - **Blind Algorithm** - the simplest implementation. Searches function space pseudo-randomly
  - **Genetic Algorithm** - probably very well known algorithm. Library is implemented to use collection of Double values to represent possible solutions instead of binary arrays.
  - **Self Organized Migration Algorithm (SOMA)** - there is currently only implementation called SomaManyToOne - more detailes about algorithm can be found at its homepage http://www.ft.utb.cz/people/zelinka/soma/

> Library use **MersenneTwister** implementation from **Apache Commons** for random numbers.
