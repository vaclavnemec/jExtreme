jExtreme
=========

jExtreme is a Java library which provides implementations for mathematical optimization of functions (functions can be defined as lambdas). Library offers three optimization algorithms:

  - **Blind Algorithm** - Searches space pseudo-randomly
  - **Genetic Algorithm** - Algorithm is implemented to use a collection of double values to represent possible solutions instead of binary arrays
  - **Self Organized Migration Algorithm (SOMA)** - there is currently an implementation called SomaManyToOne - more details about the algorithm can be found here [http://www.ft.utb.cz/people/zelinka/soma/](http://www.ft.utb.cz/people/zelinka/soma/)

> Library use **MersenneTwister** implementation from **Apache Commons** for random numbers.
